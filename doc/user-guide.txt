Usage:

The Scan Manager can be used to:

A. MONITOR A SCAN

# Create a NeXpose API Connection
nexpose_connection = NeXpose::Connection.new host, username, password, port

# Initialize the scan manager
# Poll NeXpose every 5 seconds for the scan status
poll_time = 5
scan_manager = ScanManager.new nexpose_connection, false, poll__time

# Add your observing class to the scan manager that defines an update method
# scan_data contains the scan ID, status, and message if any
class ScanObserver
    def update scan_data, notifier
       <do whatever with scan_data>
    end
end

scan_observer = ScanObserver.new
scan_manager.add_observer scan_observer


B. START A RESTRICTIVE SCAN

# Define the condition

conditional_scan =
    {
        :site_id   => <site ID>,
        :max_scans => 5,   # Only start scan if there are less than 5 scans running
        :devices   => <array of devices>, # IPs
        :listeners => listeners # Can be null or an observer as defined in A
    }

scan_manager.add_conditional_device_scan conditional_scan
